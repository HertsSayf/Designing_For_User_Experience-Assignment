### Design Choices -

Colour Pallete:
- Primary: `#6c5ce7` (purple) for buttons  and accents

- Dark: `#2a2a2a` for headers and text

- Light: `#eeeeee` for background

- White: `#ffffff` for cards  and sections

  - **typography**
  - Primary Font: Arial - gives a clean look and is reliable
  - Headings - Bold styling for emphasis
  - Buttons - All caps for clear CTAs - call to action

  - **Structure**
    - Layout - Consistent Header/Footer across all pages
    - Custom CSS - For unique styling and ovverrides
    - Framework - Bootstrap 3 for a grid layout to make website more appealing

  - **Imagery**
    - I used the same images from my wireframe and put them into my code to show the products

  - **Wireframes**
    - I made the website more simple looking with a more simple checkout page, this can be less confusing for the user also more user friendly.
    - I added a different heading and footer with my navigation in the heading this may be more easy accesible for a user as they know it resides in the top right of the page
