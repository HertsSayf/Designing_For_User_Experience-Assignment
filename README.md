## Introduction

I have previously developed the wireframes and now work to coding it into html and making the actual webpage. my wireframe consist of 3 main pages - the homepage, bidding page, and checkout page. By the end of my project i hope to have a completed website for BitBay which is functional and reliable to the user needs. '

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories (US)

Persona 1

Name: Alex

Age: 22

Occupation: Student/Part-time Developer

Tasks:

- The system should  allow item browsing by category so users can quickly access relevant auctions.

- I need to view detailed item  information in order to make informed bidding decisions

- I want to place bids easily so I can participate  in auctions

- I want to view the remaining time of auctions so I can plan my bidding.

Persona 2 

Name: Linda

Occupation: Retired teacher/Small business owner

Tasks:

- I want to be able to list up me vintage items for sale

- I want the items to be presented attractively in order to get more  bids

### Design Choices -

Colour Pallete:
- Primary: `#6c5ce7` (purple) for buttons  and accents

- Dark: `#2a2a2a` for headers and text

- Light: `#eeeeee` for background

- White: `#ffffff` for cards  and sections

  - **typography**
  - Primary Font: Arial - gives a clean look and is reliable
  - Headings - Bold styling for emphasis
  - Buttons - All caps for clear CTAs - call to action

  - **Structure**
    - Layout - Consistent Header/Footer across all pages
    - Custom CSS - For unique styling and ovverrides
    - Framework - Bootstrap 3 for a grid layout to make website more appealing

  - **Imagery**
    - I used the same images from my wireframe and put them into my code to show the products

  - **Wireframes**
    - I made the website more simple looking with a more simple checkout page, this can be less confusing for the user also more user friendly.
    - I added a different heading and footer with my navigation in the heading this may be more easy accesible for a user as they know it resides in the top right of the page
